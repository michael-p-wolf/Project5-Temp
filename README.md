# Class Descriptions:
- Marketplace - A detailed description of the class. This should include the functionality included in the class, the testing done to verify it works properly, and its relationship to other classes in the project.
- Database - A detailed description of the class. This should include the functionality included in the class, the testing done to verify it works properly, and its relationship to other classes in the project.
- Person - Holds the email, password, and account type information for all users that have created an account. This info is stored in Accounts.txt and is used to identify returning accounts and to create new accounts. This class has methods for checking the formatting of new emails and passwords, identifying duplicate emails, as well as for editing an account's email and password (UI included). The person class is the superclass of both customer and seller classes, which inherit these fields and methods.<br>Testing: By putting a create account/log in interface at the beginning of the main method, we could repeatedly create new Person objects and check if their account info was saved. Indeed, no duplicate emails were allowed, the formatting had to be correct, and old accounts were saved and could be accessed at a later time.
